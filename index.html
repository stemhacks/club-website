				<div class="title">What is STEMHacks?</div>

				<div class="title">What is a hackathon?</div>
				<p class="content">A hackathon is a gathering where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over a short period of time. Hackathons are at least a few days - or over a weekend - and generally no longer than a week. While working on a particular project, the idea is for each developer to be have the ability and freedom to work on whatever he/she wants.</p>

				<div class="title">What is <b>our</b> Hackathon</div>
				<p class="content">Our self titled hackathon, STEMHacks is one of the very first high-school hackathons in Pennsylvania who’s mission it is to inspire the youth to program. In 24 hours 200+ students from the tri-state area will create a project from scratch that will be judged from some of the leaders in the tech industry for a chance to win amazing prizes. With unlimited food, drink, interesting demos and workshops, and of absolutely no cost. </p>

				<div class="title">What will we do as a club?</div>
				<p class="content">During C-day meetings we will be conducting mini interactive classes on programming. Topics will vary between meetings. <br> We will be planning trips to go to various hackathons near us as a group throughout the year. <br>Also if you are interested you will be able to help with the organization our hackathon.</p>
				<!-- Organizing a hackathon is a lot of work! We need people to run the finance, gather sponsors, plan the event, hype the event and so much more. Just because it is a coding event doesn’t mean you have to have a coding background. We are looking for hard working students looking to improve their resume and make an impact on the future. <br> Working with STEMHacks is a fantastic thing to have on your resume and can act as a huge differentiator when trying to apply to college or get an internship! -->
